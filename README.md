# Team Guidelines:

* Morning DSU: “What we worked on, What will we work on, table topics (what we need help on to proceed.)”
* “When we close out a Asana ticket, we add notes as to how the work was done for future reference.” 
* “We seek to understand first, then offer feedback.”
* Mob programming on mod level tasks (Deployment/CI/CD Pipeline) - live share preferred (will take 10 mins to set-up)
* Mob programm other tasks during table topics
* Meeting with Michael at 4 or 3:30 pm every day
* Afternoon DSU 45 mins before meeting with Micahel (3:15 or 2:45)
* Individual work for features, unless pair programming is preferred
* Pull requests should be reviewed by at least one person. 
* Trunk based Development - merging to main, feature branches are short lived
* Active engagement, everyone is heard
